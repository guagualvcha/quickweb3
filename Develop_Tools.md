A guide to available tools, components, and platforms for developing applications on BSC.

## Developer Tools

### What BSC Lack Now

* The graph. The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.
* [Alethio](https://aleth.io/), An advanced Ethereum analytics platform that provides live monitoring, insights and anomaly detection, token metrics, smart contract audits, graph visualization and blockchain search. Real-time market information and trading activities across Ethereum's decentralized exchanges can also be explored. | 8(need add bsc support) |
* [Scout](https://scout.cool/), A live data feed of the activities and event logs of your smart contracts on Ethereum.
* [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/), A platform that gives users reliable smart contract monitoring and alerting in the form of a web dashboard without requiring users to host or maintain infrastructure.
* [Truffle Teams](https://trufflesuite.com/teams) - Zero-Config continuous integration for truffle projects

* [Multi sender](https://multisender.app/), This Dapp allows a user to send thousands of token transfers in a very effecient way by batching them in groups of 145 token transfers per Ethereum transaction. Already support BSC, somehow, it stuck when try to send.
* [gnosis-safe.io](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/welcome), Gnosis Safe Multisig is the most secure way to manage crypto funds collectively. It is an improvement of the Gnosis MultiSig, which is used by more than 3000 teams and stores over $1B USD worth of digital assets.

* BSC on Google Cloud.
* [ez-ens](https://github.com/merklejerk/ez-ens), Simple, zero-configuration Ethereum Name Service address resolver
* [amberdata.io](https://amberdata.io),Provides live monitoring, insights and anomaly detection, token metrics, smart contract audits, graph visualization and blockchain search.
* [gasnow](https://gasnow.sparkpool.com/), a tools to predict the gas price on Ethereum.
